<h2>Introduction</h2>
HyperStream is a viewer for Mn/DOT streaming video of traffic cameras. 
It is currently being made available to organizations that report on or
respond to situations on the metro area freeway system.  There are currently
more than 300 cameras located in the metro area which are available for viewing.<br>
<h2>Installation</h2>
Install the Java Runtime Environment 1.5 or higher.  It is available from
<a href='http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp'>Sun Microsystems</a>
This will automatically install Java WebStart which is needed to launch HyperStream.
 This must be done by someone with local admin privileges.<p>
<h2>Running</h2>
In order to run HyperStream, you must have an account.
Once your account is setup, you can view streaming video in one of two ways:<br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="/video/client/HyperStream.jnlp">Run HyperStream.</a> Java Web Start will
ask you to create shortcuts for the application.  If you experience a problem
launching the application, it is most frequently because you are behind a
proxy server.  Open Java Web Start (you can find it on your start menu) and change
the proxy settings in the preferences area.</li>
<li><strong>*NEW*</strong>Use our 
<a href="http://www.dot.state.mn.us/tmc/trafficinfo/cameras_stream.html">
embedded viewer</a>
which gives you the ability to access cameras from using a map interface.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Account Maintenance</h2>
You can change your password by using the
<a href="/video/client/passwordForm">password change form</a>.
